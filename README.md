Code test for potential Carter full stack developers

## The challenge:

![alt text](https://github.com/CarterDigital/fullstack-code-test/raw/master/CardGrid.png "Card Grid")

Produce the card grid layout as shown above (don't forget to make it responsive). All the content for the cards is coming from The CMS.

Please use specific CMS as mentioned on the email.

You can use a front-end framework if you like, but avoid plugins -  no need to change your style, just code how you normally would.

If you have time, apply some nice hover style to the card, whatever you like to show off your skills :)

Comment where needed.

Feel free to ask questions.
